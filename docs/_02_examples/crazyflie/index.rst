We are going to use `Aerostack2 Crazyflie Project <https://github.com/aerostack2/project_crazyflie>`_ for running the examples.
Install it by the following command:

This will clone the project in the directory ``$AEROSTACK2_PATH/projects/``.

    source ~/.bashrc

Go there by:

.. code-block:: bash

    as2 cd crazyflie
