We are going to use `Aerostack2 DJI Project <https://github.com/aerostack2/project_dji_matrice.git>`_ for running the examples.
Install it by the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    as2 project -n dji_matrice

This will clone the project in the directory ``$AEROSTACK2_PATH/projects/``. 
Reopen the terminal to upload the new project:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/.bashrc

Go there by:

.. code-block:: bash

    as2 cd dji_matrice

Here is the list of examples:
