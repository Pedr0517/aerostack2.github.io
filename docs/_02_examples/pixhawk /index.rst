Pixhawk 4
=========

For these examples we are going to use :ref:`Pixhawk Platform <aerial_platform_px4>`. 
You can install it following the instructions in :ref:`installation section <aerial_platform_px4_installation>`.

.. figure:: resources/px4_vision.jpg
   :scale: 50
   :class: with-shadow

We are going to use `Aerostack2 PX4 Vision Project <https://github.com/aerostack2/project_px4_vision.git>`_ for running the examples.
Install it by the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    as2 project -n px4_vision

This will clone the project in the directory ``$AEROSTACK2_PATH/projects/``. 
Reopen the terminal to upload the new project:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/.bashrc

Go there by:

.. code-block:: bash

    as2 cd px4_vision

Here is the list of examples:
